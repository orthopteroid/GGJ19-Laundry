# GGJ19-Laundry
Small single room text adventure. Written in Inform6. My first interactive fiction game and made during the graveyard shift of GGJ19, which is why I shouldn't even apologise. This year's theme was 'home' which I took to mean folding laundry and scooping cat poop. So basically my game wrote itself...

You play this game in the laundry room with a laundry machine that occasionally coughs up shirts that need folding in the company of a black cat that mills about but appears to be overendowed in the poo-production department.

The game is very simple, when a shirt appears from the machine you fold it and when the cat poops in the litter box you scoop it. Work dilligently! Don't dwadle! For in only 10 moves your guests will arrive ... and they are typically inclined to judge the general hygene and shabbiness of your domocile!
